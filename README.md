#SKELETON

Skeleton is a plugin template

Feel free to copy skeleton and change it to build out your own plugin.
A number of simple UI displays and inputs are provided to help with the development
of front end functionality for those that are more comfortable developing in
python

If you feel you have some good boiler plate code for reuse push it up and it can be
debated if it is simple enough to add# debrief
